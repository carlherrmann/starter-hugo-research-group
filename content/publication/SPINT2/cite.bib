abstract = {<p> COVID-19 outbreak is the biggest threat to human health in recent history. Currently, there are over 1.5 million related deaths and 75 million people infected around the world (as of 22/12/2020). The identification of virulence factors which determine disease susceptibility and severity in different cell types remains an essential challenge. The serine protease <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> has been shown to be important for S protein priming and viral entry, however, little is known about its regulation. <italic>SPINT2</italic> is a member of the family of Kunitz type serine protease inhibitors and has been shown to inhibit <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> . Here, we explored the existence of a co-regulation between <italic>SPINT2</italic> / <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> and found a tightly regulated protease/inhibitor expression balance across tissues. We found that <italic>SPINT2</italic> negatively correlates with SARS-CoV-2 expression in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cell lines and was down-regulated in secretory cells from COVID-19 patients. We validated our findings using Calu-3 cell lines and observed a strong increase in viral load after <italic>SPINT2</italic> knockdown, while overexpression lead to a drastic reduction of the viral load. Additionally, we evaluated the expression of <italic>SPINT2</italic> in datasets from comorbid diseases using bulk and scRNA-seq data. We observed its down-regulation in colon, kidney and liver tumors as well as in alpha pancreatic islets cells from diabetes Type 2 patients, which could have implications for the observed comorbidities in COVID-19 patients suffering from chronic diseases. </p>},
