We apply deep neural networks to combine multiple datasets to (1) achieve a better stratification of patient cohorts, or (2) improve the definition of chromatin states by combining ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data. 
We apply generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate single-cell modalities from other single-cell datasets.
