We are developing various flavors of non-negative matrix factorization to extract lower dimensional representation from multi-omics data layers in bulk and single-cell genomics. This is based on our [ButchR package](https://github.com/hdsu-bioquant/ButchR), which allows to perform non-negative matrix factorizations for bulk and single-cell datasets. Check out our [shiny application](https://hdsu-bioquant.shinyapps.io/shinyButchR/).
